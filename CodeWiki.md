The decode side has zero dependencies on the encode side; either can be vendored
independently.

## Two codecs

- **Fast** (levels 1-5) — greedy/lazy parser, raw or entropy-coded literals
- **High** (levels 6-11) — optimal DP parser, full entropy coding

**Entry points:**
- CLI: `main.zig` → `cli.zig`
- Library: `streamlz.zig` (re-exports `compressFramed` / `decompressFramed`)

## Parallel architecture

### Decode

| Levels | Strategy | How it works |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| L1 | SC group-parallel | Encoder compresses each 256KB chunk independently (no cross-chunk refs). Decoded via `decompressCoreParallel` using frame header's `sc_group_size`. No sidecar. |
| L2-L4 | Sidecar (small) | Per-block BFS closure sidecar (~150 KB/100 MB). Workers decode contiguous slices independently. |
| L5 | Sidecar (large) | Per-block sidecar (~1.2 MB/100 MB) with cross-chunk source bytes at depth ≥ 1. |
| L6-L8 | SC group-parallel | Encoder constrains chunks to self-contained groups (adaptive size, ~16 groups per file). Each group decoded independently. |
| L9-L11 | Two-phase | Phase 1: parallel entropy decode + resolveTokens. Phase 2: serial token execution. |

### Compress

| Levels | Threading | How it works |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| L1 | Parallel | Per-chunk workers with independent hashers (SC mode). |
| L2-L5 | Serial | Single-threaded greedy/lazy parser. |
| L6-L8 | Parallel | Per-group workers with independent match finders (SC mode). |
| L9-L11 | Parallel | Per-block workers sharing pre-computed MLS. |

All decode paths share a persistent `std.Thread.Pool` to avoid per-call thread spawn cost.

## Pointer safety

- `[]u8` slices at all public API boundaries.
- `[*]u8` raw pointers for struct fields that advance through a buffer (hot-loop iterators).
- Every raw pointer stored in a struct field has a matching `std.debug.assert` that validates bounds in Debug / ReleaseSafe builds — zero cost in ReleaseFast.
- See `io/bit_writer.zig` `initBounded` for the canonical pattern.

## Key invariants

For anyone modifying the hot loops:

1. **`@Vector(16, u8)` not `@Vector(32, u8)`.** AVX2 (32-byte
   loads/stores) throttles Arrow Lake frequency under load and is measurably
   slower for this workload. Confirmed via direct A/B tests.

2. **`wildCopy16` interleaved load-store-load-store ordering** (not load-load-
   store-store). The interleave is REQUIRED for small-offset LZ match
   propagation: a single 16-byte vector load would read unwritten bytes from
   past the write cursor, breaking RLE-like patterns. Locked in by an
   isolation test in `copy_helpers.zig`.

3. **tANS `src_start` / `src_end` capture order.** Must be set on the parameter
   block BEFORE state-init shifts `src` / `srcEnd` by ±4. The decode hot loop's
   bounds check uses the "outer" range and intentionally steps into the
   state-init overlap region. Easy to miss when porting — see commit `bbfadc1`.

4. **SC per-group `dst_start`.** L6-L8 chunks group in 4s for the SC path. The
   decoder must pass a group-local `dst_start` (not whole-buffer-start) to each
   chunk so the encoder's per-group "first chunk = base_offset 0" assumption
   holds and the initial 8-byte raw `Copy64` fires at each group's start.

5. **Tail prefix restoration (SC only).** Encoder stores `(num_chunks − 1) × 8`
   bytes at the end of each frame block. After decoding all chunks, overwrite
   first 8 bytes of every chunk except chunk 0 with those tail bytes.

6. **`comptime mode: LiteralMode`** in `decode/fast/fast_lz_decoder.zig`
   (`processModeImpl`) generates two specialized functions (delta-literal vs
   raw-literal). Unambiguous win for branch-free hot loops because there's only
   one callsite per specialization.

7. **Default build target `x86_64_v3`.** Set in `build.zig` so binaries are
   portable across modern Intel and AMD x86_64 hosts. AVX-512 instructions
   from `-mcpu=native` on Arrow Lake crashed earlier builds on Ryzen 3800x.

## Cleanness analyzer (`streamlz analyze`)

A diagnostic-only token-dependency-DAG analyzer lives in
`decode/cross_chunk_analyzer.zig`. It walks an `.slz` file's LZ tokens, builds
the per-byte dependency DAG, and reports:
- Total match tokens
- Critical path depth (longest dependency chain)
- Round histogram (how many tokens at each depth in the DAG)
- Theoretical parallel-decode speedup with N cores

Built during a session that explored speculative parallel decode for L1-L5.
Conclusion: theoretical parallelism is large (~24× at 24 cores), but the
analyzer itself takes 60-300 ms per 100 MB input — far longer than the ~16 ms
decode it would speed up. Kept for offline diagnostic work.

## Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Fast codec | Greedy/lazy LZ parser, levels 1-5. Fast compress + decompress. |
| High codec | Optimal DP parser, levels 6-11. Slower compress, same decompress speed. |
| tANS | Tabled Asymmetric Numeral System — entropy coder used for literal streams. |
| BT4 | Binary Tree 4-way — match finder used by the High codec's optimal parser. |
| SC | Self-Contained — block format flag; each block decodes independently. |
| Sidecar | Optional parallel-decode metadata block (cross-chunk dependency map). |
| Chunk | 256 KB decompression unit. Sub-chunk = 128 KB half. |
| Cross-chunk | A match whose source bytes are in a different chunk than its target. |
| Cleanness | Whether a byte's dependency chain stays within one chunk (no cross-chunk refs). |
| PPOC | Parallel Producer/Consumer — sidecar builder. |
| MLS | Managed Match Length Storage — variable-length match table for the High codec. |
